Here I build an image captioning model by combining a pre-trained VGG-16 image encoder from with LSTM-based language decoder from. 

This is an implementation of the following paper:

Show and tell: A neural image caption generator, O. Vinyals, A. Toshev, S. Bengio, D. Erhan, CVPR,
2015.

which requires the steps detailed below.
